In this project I managed to create a mobile-first and totally responsive newspaper site from scratch.
This repository has been made for the Radium Rocket Class assignment, focussing on the use of CSS and Flexbox to create a layout.
The buttons (e.x search, menu, sign in) wont work yet, as we first need to learn to apply JavaScript into our projects, that's due to next week surely, looking forward to it.

The idea of the layout was to add more content to the website as your viewport expands, for example on mobile the navigation buttons will only be visible if you press the hamburger icon, on tablet, said buttons will appear below the title of the newspaper, and on desktop you'll see more news on the lower sections of the page, plus the news on the left will now show some info about the reading.

Something i'll look forward on fixing is why on desktop view the containers with the class name "boxList" on the "desktopOnly" div tag won't show properly alligned with the same group of "boxList" on the left, it could be a problem with the images being of different resolution and being resized with the class.

special thanks to the tuthor, Nicolas Viola, for the corrections given during this course,
